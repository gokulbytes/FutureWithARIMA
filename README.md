# FutureWithARIMA

As a Data Science Intern, I translated theoretical knowledge into practical, business-driven applications. My work encompassed the full data lifecycle, from wrangling complex datasets to developing and deploying robust machine learning models that delivered tangible business value. I transformed raw data into actionable insights, directly influencing strategic decisions.

I utilized Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn) and SQL for projects like customer churn analysis, where I built a predictive model to improve customer retention. Through advanced statistical analysis and hypothesis testing, I identified key drivers of user engagement and sales. I then visualized these insights using Tableau and Matplotlib, creating interactive dashboards that empowered non-technical stakeholders with data-driven information and facilitated cross-departmental understanding.

My contributions extended to operational efficiency, where I streamlined data pipelines and automated preprocessing tasks, enhancing data integrity and team productivity. I also documented new methodologies, fostering best practices and project reproducibility. This hands-on experience honed my technical and problem-solving skills within a fast-paced, collaborative environment.

I collaborated with product managers and engineers to understand business requirements and scope analytical solutions, bridging the gap between technical data work and business objectives. This practical application of data science principles from feature engineering and model training to impact quantification has provided an invaluable foundation for my career.
